# Interior Point Methods

For decades the Simplex algorithm was the only competitive method for linear optimization. One of the major shortcomings of the Simplex algorithm is that the number of steps required to solve the problem can grow exponentially with the size of the linear system. So for large linear programs, the Simplex algorithm is too computationally expensive to be a viable optimization method. Interior Point methods offer an alternative approach and enjoy much better theoretical convergence properties.

In this repository I implement both linear and quadratic interior point methods and use KKT conditions to account for constraints. In the `interior_point_linear.ipynb` notebook, I implement a linear interior point method to compare linear and least absolute deviation regressions. In the `interior_point_quadratic.ipynb` notebook, I adjust my interior point method to account for quadratic objective functions and use it to study elastic membranes for circus tents and Markowitz Portfolio Optimization. 

Simply volving the KKT equations in a Primal-Dual interior point method can be too greedy however, and this can cause us to step out of the feasible region of optimal points. So solve this, very smart people implemented the `duality measure`. Taking steps in directions that result in strictly decreasing duality measurers makes sure we stay in the feasible region and don't violate constraints.
